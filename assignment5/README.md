Both of the arrays were partitioned using type=complete with dim1 using dim=1 and both using dim=0. Partitioning both dimensions decreases the time from 5.406 to 4.914 ns, the latency cycles from 169 to 105 (cuting each loop's latency roughly in half), and the BRAM 18K from 24 to 0 while increasing the FF and LUT from 1039 to 1083 and 1063 to 1773 respectively. This seems to indicate that partitioning the array decreases the time and latency but may increase the memory depending on how decrease BRAM 18K compares to the the increase in FF and LUT
